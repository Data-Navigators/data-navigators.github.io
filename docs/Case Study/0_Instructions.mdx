Welcome to the Case Study section of our data analysis course! Here, you will apply the concepts and techniques you've learned to solve real-world business problems using simulated datasets. 

Each case study is accompanied by a description of the business context and a set of problems we believe will challenge and engage you. These problems span various aspects of data analysis, including data cleaning, visualization, statistical modeling, and deriving actionable insights.

This section is not only about finding solutions but also about understanding the process of data-driven decision-making. We encourage you to think critically, explore multiple approaches, and leverage the power of data to uncover meaningful insights.

## How many case studies should I attempt?
You are required to solve only 1 case study for successful completion of this course. Please pair with a fellow participant for solving the case study.

## Which environment do I use for doing analysis?
The datasets are shared on Kaggle. You can use Kaggle as a platform to create a notebook and solve this case study.
You can also use your local development environments if you are more comfortable using them. We recommend using Kaggle for now for saving time and easily sharing your work.

## How do I share the results of my analysis?
You will get a chance to showcase your analysis to your trainers in a 30 min session. Think of this as a session to practice your data storytelling skills.
You will also be required to share the presented notebook with the trainers for detailed evaluation and feedback.

## What are the expected Outcomes from my case study analysis?

1. Pick any two questions that you find interesting and produce your results in a presentable format so that you can cover your analysis in 30 mins. (Try not to spend too much time on generating slide decks, but experiment with converting code outcomes to slides.)
2. Present your results assuming that you are talking to the Sales team (and not Data Analysts). Use simplified and business relevant storytelling.
3. The Panel will use 15 min to ask you technical questions after the presentation and provide feedback. This will be the time to showcase your learning and technical prowess.
4. Please use visualizations to explain your analysis or results where necessary.
5. Use data to support your recommendations while also putting your recommendations as statements to ensure a non-data person can understand them.
6. Think about the domain to decide what metrics make most sense and explain what calculation you have used to arrive at them. Include the any details like, calculations in the appendix (but do talk about them in your case study presentation, so that sales folks can confirm if they agree to your metric and can use it)

## A sample content structure for sharing Analysis:

1. Problem Introduction
2. Data Understanding
3. Cleaning and Processing steps, impact on data.
4. Assumptions made (if any for cleaning and processing)
5. Key Visualizations and findings
6. Recommendations and Possible Next steps

Feel free to modify this based on your need, but try to keep the elements which will help the Sales folks understand your approach and outcomes.

          **Happy learning!**
