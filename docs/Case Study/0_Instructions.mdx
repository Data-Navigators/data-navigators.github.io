Welcome to the Case Study section of our data analysis course! Here, you will apply the concepts and techniques you've learned to solve real-world business problems using simulated datasets. 

Each case study is accompanied by a description of the business context and a set of problems we believe will challenge and engage you. These problems span various aspects of data analysis, including data cleaning, visualization, statistical modeling, and deriving actionable insights.

This section is not only about finding solutions but also about understanding the process of data-driven decision-making. We encourage you to think critically, explore multiple approaches, and leverage the power of data to uncover meaningful insights.

## How many case studies should I attempt?
You are required to solve only 1 case study for successful completion of this course. Please pair with a fellow participant for solving the case study.

## Which environment do I use for doing analysis?
The datasets are shared on Kaggle. You can use Kaggle as a platform to create a notebook and solve this case study.
You can use your local development environments to present your case study if you are more comfortable using them.

## How do I share the results of my analysis?
You will get a chance to showcase your analysis to your trainers in a 45 min session. Think of this as a session to practice your data storytelling skills.
You will also be required to share the presented notebook with the trainers for detailed evaluation and feedback.
