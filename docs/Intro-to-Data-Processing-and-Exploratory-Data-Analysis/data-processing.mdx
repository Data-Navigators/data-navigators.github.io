# Data Processing

In latest modern world, Business decisions are always based on data, and the quality of those decisions depends on the quality of the data. An expert data analysis is highly needed to make right data-driven decisions. 
Data processing is the first and most important step in data analysis. It involves collecting, cleaning, transforming, and analyzing data to derive meaningful insights. 
In this notebook, we will explore the data processing pipeline and go through the basics of data processing and exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Python and Pandas.

## Table of Contents
1. Data Collection 
2. Data Structuring
3. Data Cleaning

Data Analysis of any data can be performed in many ways. Predominantly, Data Analysis are done using Python, R, SQL in the industry. Depending on the source data available format, kind of analysis needed and the final decisions and report expected, the choice of tool needs to be choosen.

However, We will use Python notebook, and  we will be using Python Libraries and Pandas for Data Analysis for ease of development environment setup and interoperability . But the same can be done using R and SQL as well.

We will be using the referenced [notebook](docs/Intro-to-Data-Processing-and-Exploratory-Data-Analysis/data-analysis-data-processing-v2.ipynb) 
and the corresponding resource available in [resources](docs/Intro-to-Data-Processing-and-Exploratory-Data-Analysis/resources) section for the data processing and exploratory data analysis.
