# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is an approach to analyzing data sets to summarize their main characteristics, often with visual methods. EDA is used to understand what the data can tell us beyond the formal modeling or hypothesis testing task. It is a crucial step in the data analysis process.
In the referenced notebook, we will go through the each columns of the dataset and understand the data distribution, important statistics parameters. We will also visualize the data using different plots and graphs to understand the data better.
