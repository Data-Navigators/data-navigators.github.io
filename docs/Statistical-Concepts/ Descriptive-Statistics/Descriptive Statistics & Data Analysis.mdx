## Why Descriptive Statistics? ü§î


 ![statistics.png](./assets/statistics.png)

Descriptive statistics are like the foundation of a house üè†‚Äîthey help you build a solid understanding of your dataset. As the name suggests, they help describe the dataset. 

They help answer **common business questions** like,**"As a cafe that bakes muffins everyday, how many muffins should I prepare tomorrow?"**

And, some **complex business questions** for an online retail merchant like, **"Which product categories show the most inconsistent customer ratings?"**

A short example to show how to estimate the number of muffins to bake tomorrow:
```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
# Typically this data would come from sales records.
# For simplicity, we will simulate the sales data for last 30 days 
np.random.seed(42)
data = pd.DataFrame({
    'day': pd.date_range(start='2023-01-01', periods=30, freq='D'),
    'sales': np.random.randint(30, 100, size=30)
})
print(f"Simulated sales adta: {data}")
# Calculate the mean sales
mean_sales = data['sales'].mean()
# Estimate the number of muffins to bake tomorrow
estimated_muffins = mean_sales
print(f"Estimated muffins to bake tomorrow: {round(estimated_muffins,2)}")
```

### What does this code do?  
- It simulates sales data for 30 days, calculates the average sales, and estimates the number of muffins to bake for tomorrow based on that average.

### üìö Statistical Symbols Glossary

| **Symbol** | **Meaning**                                                                 |
|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Œ£**      | Sum of all values or terms.                                                 |
| **x**      | A data point or value in the dataset.                                       |
| **Œº (Mu)** | The mean (average) of the dataset or population.                            |
| **n**      | The total number of data points in the dataset or sample size.              |
| **œÉ (Sigma)** | The standard deviation of the dataset or population.                     |
| **œÉ¬≤ (Sigma Squared)** | The variance of the dataset or population.                            |
| **(x - Œº)** | The difference between a data point and the mean, or the deviation from the mean. |
| **(x - Œº)¬≥** | The deviation from the mean raised to the third power (used in skewness).  |
| **P(x)** | The probability of observing a value x in a probability distribution.         |
| **Z**      | The **Z-score**, which represents how many standard deviations a data point is from the mean. |
