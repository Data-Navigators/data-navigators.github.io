## Why Descriptive Statistics? 🤔


 ![statistics.png](./assets/statistics.png)

Descriptive statistics are like the foundation of a house 🏠—they help you build a solid understanding of your dataset. Whether you want to know the **average** value, how **spread out** the data is, or how **skewed** it might be, these statistics are essential for summarizing and making sense of data. Let’s explore the key concepts!

1. **Mean** 🧮
   - The average value of the dataset.
   - Helps in identifying the central value in the distribution.

2. **Median** 🔢
   - The middle value when data is sorted.
   - Important for understanding the center of the distribution, especially when the data contains outliers.

3. **Mode** ➿

    - The most frequently occurring value in the dataset.
   - Useful for identifying the most common observation in the dataset.

4. **Skewness** 📐

   - A measure of the asymmetry of the data distribution.
   - Skewness indicates whether the data is skewed to the left (negative skew) or right (positive skew).

5.  **Kurtosis** 🚀

   - A measure of the "tailedness" of the data distribution.
   - Helps to understand the presence of outliers in the dataset, with higher kurtosis indicating more extreme values.

   | Statistic | Definition | Significance | Interpretation |
|-----------|------------|--------------|-----------------|
| **Mean** | Average of values | Central tendency | Sensitive to outliers |
| **Median** | Middle value | Central tendency | Less affected by outliers |
| **Mode** | Most frequent value | Commonality | Useful for categorical data |
| **Skewness** | Asymmetry measure | Distribution shape | Positive or negative skew indicates concentration of values |
| **Kurtosis** | Tailedness measure | Outlier likelihood | High kurtosis indicates more extreme values |

## Dataset:
We will be using a retail dataset, specifically focusing on the **Total Amount** column, which represents the total amount of transactions made by customers.

## Steps Covered:
1. Calculate the **Mean**, **Median**, and **Mode** of the **Total Amount** in the dataset to determine the central tendencies.
2. Analyze the **Skewness** and **Kurtosis** of the **Total Amount** to understand the distribution shape and the presence of any outliers.

### Why is this important?
Descriptive statistics are foundational for any form of data analysis. They provide simple summaries about the data, which can be either a representation of the entire dataset or just an attribute of the data. Understanding these statistics is crucial for making data-driven decisions and interpreting data distributions accurately.
