# Retail Dataset Analysis & Problem Solving 📦🛒

In this module, we will explore a **Retail Sales Dataset** and dive into various problem-solving exercises that will help us understand key statistical concepts like **descriptive statistics, distributions, and visualizations**.

## Retail Dataset Overview 🗂

The **Retail Dataset** contains information about sales transactions, customers, and products. Let’s start by getting familiar with the columns in the dataset and understanding what they represent.

### Columns in the Dataset:

1. **Customer ID** 🔑
   - A unique identifier for each customer in the dataset.
  
2. **Gender** 👩‍🦰👨‍🦱
   - The gender of the customer (Male or Female).
  
3. **Age** 🎂
   - The age of the customer.
  
4. **Product Category** 🛍️
   - The category to which the purchased product belongs (e.g., Electronics, Clothing, Home Appliances, etc.).
  
5. **Quantity** 🛒
   - The number of units of the product purchased in the transaction.
  
6. **Price per Unit** 💵
   - The price of a single unit of the product purchased.
  
7. **Total Amount** 💰
   - The total amount spent by the customer for the transaction, calculated as `Quantity * Price per Unit`.

## Solutions 💡

## Questions:

1. **Descriptive Statistics for Numerical Columns**
   - Calculate the mean, median, min, max, and standard deviation for the following numerical columns: **Age, Quantity, Price per Unit, and Total Amount**.
   - What can you infer from these descriptive statistics?


<details>
  <summary>📊 Mean, Median, Mode , Skewnes and Kurtosis : Total Amount</summary>

  - **Mean**: 456.000
  - **Median**: 135.0
  - **Mode**:  50.0
  - **Skewness**: 1.376128
  - **Kurtosis**:  0.815031

</details>


2. **Visualizing Distributions of Numerical Variables**
   - Create histograms with KDE plots for the numerical variables **Age, Quantity, Price per Unit,** and **Total Amount**.
   - What do the shapes of these distributions (normal, skewed, etc.) tell you?

3. **Frequency Distribution of Categorical Variables**
   - Visualize the frequency distribution for **Gender** and **Product Category**.
   - Is the data balanced, or does one category dominate?

4. **Relationship Between Age and Total Amount Spent**
   - Create a scatter plot to explore the relationship between **Age** and **Total Amount** spent.
   - What patterns or trends can you identify? Are there any outliers?

5. **Sales by Product Category**
   - Analyze the total sales for each product category.
   - Which product categories generate the most revenue?

6. **Average Transaction Value by Gender**
   - Calculate the average transaction value for each gender.
   - Is there a significant difference in spending between male and female customers?
