Before diving into statistical techniques, it's important to understand the foundational terms used in statistics. The table below introduces key terms you'll encounter frequently, explained in simple, non-technical language to help build a strong conceptual base.

### ðŸ“˜ Basic Statistics Glossary

| **Term**              | **Meaning **                                                                 | Why It Matters?                                                                 |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Data**              | Raw numbers or facts collected for analysis (e.g., sales numbers, survey responses).         |    Forms the basis of all statistical analysis.                                      |
| **Variable**          | A measurable attribute or property that can change (like age, income, or product type).      |    Helps identify what you're studying.                                          |
| **Population**        | The complete group you're interested in analyzing (e.g., all users of your app). Population mean denoted as Î¼            |    Helps define the scope of your study.                                          |
| **Sample**            | A smaller group taken from the population to study when you canâ€™t measure everyone.          |    Makes analysis manageable and cost-effective.                                 |
| **Observation** (x)      | A single recorded instance (e.g., one customer's response or one transaction).               |    Represents the data points you analyze.                                      |
| **Statistic**         | A value (like a mean) calculated from a sample.                                              |    Helps summarize and understand the sample data.                             |
| **Parameter**         | A value that describes an entire population (usually estimated from a sample).               |    Helps understand the population without measuring it directly.            |
| **Distribution**      | Describes how values are spread out across the data (e.g., normal, skewed, uniform).         |    Helps understand the shape and spread of data.                       |
| **Outlier**           | A value much higher or lower than the rest â€” possibly an error or rare event.                |    Helps identify unusual data points that may affect analysis.         |
| **Range**             | Difference between the largest and smallest values.                                          |    Provides a quick view of data spread.                                      |
| **Frequency**         | How often a specific value or category appears in the data.                                  |    Helps identify common patterns or trends.                                 |
| **Confidence Interval** | A range in which we expect the true value to fall, with a certain level of confidence.     |    Provides a measure of uncertainty in estimates.                          |
| **Probability**          | The likelihood of an event occurring, expressed as a number between 0 and 1.              |    Helps assess risk and make informed decisions.                          |
| **Symmetric** | A distribution where values are evenly spread around the mean.                        |    Indicates a balanced dataset.                                             |
| **Skewed**           | A distribution where values are not evenly spread, leading to a tail on one side.           |    Indicates potential outliers or data issues.                             |
| **Tailedness** | A measure of how heavy the tails of a distribution are, indicating the presence of outliers. |    Helps assess the risk of extreme values.                                 |
| **Central Tendency** | A measure that represents the center of a dataset (mean, median, mode).                     |    Helps summarize data with a single value.                                 |
| **Dispersion**       | A measure of how spread out the values are (range, variance, standard deviation).            |    Helps understand the variability in the data.                             |
| **Correlation**      | A measure of the relationship between two variables (positive, negative, or none).          |    Helps identify relationships and dependencies.                           |
| **Causation**        | Indicates that one event is the result of another (e.g., smoking causes lung cancer).       |    Helps understand cause-and-effect relationships.                          |
| **Continuous variable** | A variable that can take any value within a range (e.g., height, weight).                |    Helps model real-world phenomena.                                         |
| **Discrete variable** | A variable that can only take specific values (e.g., number of students).                  |    Helps model countable phenomena.                                          |
| **Probability Distribution** | A function that describes the likelihood of different outcomes in a random experiment. |    Helps model uncertainty and make predictions.                            |
