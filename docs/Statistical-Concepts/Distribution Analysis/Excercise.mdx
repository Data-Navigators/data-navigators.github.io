## Exercises

In this module, we will analyze the distribution of various numerical variables in the retail dataset. This will include visualizations and statistical tests to understand the characteristics of the data, such as normality and the probability distribution of transactions.

### Questions

1. **What is the distribution of the `Total Amount` variable?**
   - Use a histogram and a Kernel Density Estimate (KDE) plot to visualize the distribution of the `Total Amount`.

2. **Does the `Total Amount` variable follow a normal distribution?**
   - Create a Q-Q plot to visually assess the normality of the `Total Amount`.

3. **Is the `Total Amount` normally distributed according to the Shapiro-Wilk test?**
   - Conduct the Shapiro-Wilk test for normality and interpret the results.

4. **What is the probability of having exactly 10 transactions in a day?**
   - Analyze the daily transactions and calculate the Poisson probability for 10 transactions.

5. **How do the observed daily transactions compare to the expected Poisson distribution?**
   - Visualize the observed number of daily transactions against the expected Poisson distribution.
