# Data Processing

In today's world, business decisions rely heavily on data, and their quality depends on the data's accuracy. Expert data analysis is crucial for making the right data-driven decisions.
Data processing is the essential first step in analysis, involving the collection, cleaning, transformation, and analysis of data to extract meaningful insights.
The choice of tools will depend on factors like:
1. Properties of data (e.g. Volume, variety, verasity)
2. Type of analytics (e.g. Descriptive, Predictive, Prescriptive)
3. Reporting needs from business. (e.g. Dashboards, real-time insights that impact user facing products)

In this notebook, we will explore the data processing pipeline and cover the basics of data processing and exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Python and Pandas.
