# Advanced SQL: Window and Aggregate Functions

There are a lot of interesting functions to transform and add properties to your dataset


* What limitations have you faced in your analytics when using GROUP BY in the past?
* How can you do rankings per each category efficiently?
* How can you get the entire row of the best-selling product? (imagine you want to see additional attributes of this product)


In SQL, window functions and aggregate functions are powerful tools that allow you to perform complex calculations on your data. In this guide, we'll cover the basics of these functions and show you how to use them to get the most out of your SQL queries.

## Aggregate Functions

Aggregate functions allow you to perform calculations on a set of values and return a single result. Some of the most common aggregate functions include:

- `SUM`: Calculates the sum of all values in a given column.
- `AVG`: Calculates the average of all values in a given column.
- `MIN`: Returns the minimum value in a given column.
- `MAX`: Returns the maximum value in a given column.
- `COUNT`: Returns the number of rows in a given column.

Here's an example of how you might use an aggregate function in SQL:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM customers;
```

This query returns the total number of rows in the `customers` table.

## Window Functions

Window functions are a type of function that allows you to perform calculations across a set of rows that are related to the current row. Some of the most common window functions include:

- `ROW_NUMBER`: Returns the number of the current row within its partition.
- `RANK`: Returns the rank of the current row with its partition.
- `DENSE_RANK`: Returns the rank of the current row within its partition, with ties receiving the same rank and leaving gaps.
- `LEAD`: Returns the value of a given column for the next row in the partition.
- `LAG`: Returns the value of a given column for the previous row in the partition.

Here's an example of how you might use a window function in SQL:

```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name, salary, 
       ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) as row_number 
FROM employees;
```

This query returns the `first_name`, `last_name`, and `salary` columns from the `employees` table, along with a `row_number` column that indicates the number of the current row within its partition.



Here is a Markdown formatted document about parsing JSON in Snowflake:

# Parsing JSON in Snowflake

Snowflake provides powerful functions for working with JSON data. One of the most commonly used functions is `PARSE_JSON()`, which allows you to extract data from JSON strings and convert it into Snowflake data types.

## Using PARSE_JSON()

The `PARSE_JSON()` function takes a JSON-formatted string as input and returns a variant data type representing the JSON structure. Here's a basic example:

```sql
SELECT 
  PARSE_JSON('{"name": "John Doe", "age": 35, "email": "john.doe@example.com"}')
FROM values(1);
```

This query will return a result similar to the following:

```
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "age": 35,
  "email": "john.doe@example.com"
}
```

## Accessing JSON Elements

Once you have parsed the JSON data using `PARSE_JSON()`, you can access individual elements using dot notation or array indexing. For example:

```sql
SELECT
  PARSE_JSON('{"name": "John Doe", "age": 35, "email": "john.doe@example.com"}'):'name' AS name,
  PARSE_JSON('{"name": "John Doe", "age": 35, "email": "john.doe@example.com"}'):'age' AS age,
  PARSE_JSON('{"name": "John Doe", "age": 35, "email": "john.doe@example.com"}'):'email' AS email
FROM values(1);
```

This will return:

```
name        age  email
----------  ---  -------------------
John Doe    35   john.doe@example.com
```

## Casting JSON Elements

You can also cast the extracted JSON elements to specific data types. For example:

```sql
SELECT
  PARSE_JSON('{"name": "John Doe", "age": 35, "email": "john.doe@example.com"}'):'name'::VARCHAR AS name,
  PARSE_JSON('{"name": "John Doe", "age": 35, "email": "john.doe@example.com"}'):'age'::INTEGER AS age,
  PARSE_JSON('{"name": "John Doe", "age": 35, "email": "john.doe@example.com"}'):'email'::VARCHAR AS email
FROM values(1);
```

This will return the same result as the previous example, but with the appropriate data types for each column.

## Nested JSON

`PARSE_JSON()` can also handle nested JSON structures. For example:

```sql
SELECT
  PARSE_JSON('{"name": "John Doe", "address": {"street": "123 Main St", "city": "Anytown", "state": "CA"}}'):'name' AS name,
  PARSE_JSON('{"name": "John Doe", "address": {"street": "123 Main St", "city": "Anytown", "state": "CA"}}'):'address':'street' AS street,
  PARSE_JSON('{"name": "John Doe", "address": {"street": "123 Main St", "city": "Anytown", "state": "CA"}}'):'address':'city' AS city,
  PARSE_JSON('{"name": "John Doe", "address": {"street": "123 Main St", "city": "Anytown", "state": "CA"}}'):'address':'state' AS state
FROM values(1);
```

This will return:

```
name        street           city       state
----------  ---------------  ---------- -----
John Doe    123 Main St      Anytown    CA
```

Remember, the `PARSE_JSON()` function is very powerful and can handle a wide range of JSON structures. It's an essential tool for working with JSON data in Snowflake.


## Conclusion

Aggregate and window functions are powerful tools that can help you to perform complex calculations on your SQL data. By mastering these functions, you can gain a deeper understanding of your data and create more insightful reports and visualizations.
