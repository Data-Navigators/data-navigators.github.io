# Exercise 1 

## Create Table for Country Emissions

To create a table called `co2_emissions_by_country` in the `carbon_emissions` schema, you will use the data from the `STG_EMISSIONS_BY_COUNTRY` view to analyze and populate the table.

And TotalEmission column is same as `Annual_CO2_emissions` column from `STG_EMISSIONS_BY_COUNTRY` view

## Your output table should contain:
- YEAR: integer
- COUNTRY: string
- TOTALEMISSIONS: float
- PERCAPITAEMISSIONS: float
- SHAREOFGLOBALEMISSIONS: float
## Sample Output 

| YEAR | COUNTRY  | TOTALEMISSIONS | PERCAPITAEMISSIONS | SHAREOFGLOBALEMISSIONS |
|------|----------|----------------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| 1978 | Suriname |     2.391861   |     6.681176       |        0.012616       |
| 1979 | Suriname |     2.292768   |     6.38654        |        0.011779       |



:::tip
To handle null values and convert a column to an integer using `COALESCE` or `NULLIF` and `CAST`, use the following expression:

```sql
CAST(COALESCE(column_name, 0) AS INTEGER) AS new_column
```

This will replace null values in the `column_name` with 0 before casting it to an integer. Adjust the column name and replacement value as needed in your specific case.

:::note

In the SQL statement, the use of double quotes around the YEAR column name is necessary because it is a reserved keyword in Snowflake. 

``` select "YEAR" FROM TABLE ```
