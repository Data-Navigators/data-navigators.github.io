# Exercise 2 
## Create View for Aggregate Global Emissions

In this exercise, you will create a view called `aggregate_global_emissions` in the `carbon_emissions` schema. This view will aggregate the total CO2 emissions globally on an annual basis using the data from the `co2_emissions_by_country` table.

To create the view with the desired columns:

1. Select the `Year` column from the `co2_emissions_by_country` table.
2. Calculate the sum of `TotalEmissions` for each year to obtain the total emissions globally.
3. Assign meaningful aliases to the columns to improve readability and maintain consistency with the desired output table structure.
4. Store the results in the `aggregate_global_emissions` view within the `carbon_emissions` schema.

## Your output view should contain:

- YEAR: integer
- TOTALEMISSIONS:float

## Sample Output 

| TOTALEMISSIONS | YEAR |
|----------------|------|
|  74665.790947  | 1978 |
|  74492.606202  | 1983 |


:::note

In the SQL statement, the use of double quotes around the YEAR column name is necessary because it is a reserved keyword in Snowflake. 

``` select "YEAR" FROM TABLE ```
