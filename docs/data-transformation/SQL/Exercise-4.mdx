# Exercise 4 

## Create Table for Aggregate Global Emissions and Temperatures


To analyze the relationship between global emissions and temperatures, you will perform an INNER JOIN between the results of two views: `aggregate_global_emissions` and `aggregate_global_temperatures`. This join will combine the data from both views based on the common "Year" column.

To create a table called `aggregate_global_emissions_temperatures` with the desired columns in the `global_temperatures` schema:

1. Perform an INNER JOIN between the `aggregate_global_emissions` and `aggregate_global_temperatures` table on the "Year" column.
2. Select the following columns from the joined data:
   - YEAR: Integer
   - TOTALEMISSIONS: Float
   - LANDAVERAGETEMPERATURE: Float
   - LANDMAXTEMPERATURE: Float
   - LANDMINTEMPERATURE: Float
   - LANDANDOCEANAVERAGETEMPERATURE: Float

Your output table, `aggregate_global_emissions_temperatures` , should have the above schema.


Sample Output

| YEAR | TOTALEMISSIONS | LANDAVERAGETEMPERATURE | LANDMAXTEMPERATURE | LANDMINTEMPERATURE | LANDANDOCEANAVERAGETEMPERATURE |
|------|----------------|-----------------------|--------------------|--------------------|-------------------------------|
| 1991 | 88534.588762  | 9.179416667           | 9.774              | -0.129             | 15.598                        |
| 2000 | 92645.114758  | 9.201166667           | 9.863              | -1.333             | 15.610666667                   |

:::note

In the SQL statement, the use of double quotes around the YEAR column name is necessary because it is a reserved keyword in Snowflake. 

``` select "YEAR" FROM TABLE ```
