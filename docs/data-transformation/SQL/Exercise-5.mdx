# Exercise 5

## Create Table for Aggregate Country Temperatures


The objective of this exercise is to aggregate temperature measurements per country on an annual basis using the data from the `stg_temperatures_by_country` source. 
Additionally, you will need to clean up the "Country" column by removing leading/trailing spaces and converting the country names to the proper format.

To create a table called `aggregate_country_temperatures` with the desired columns in the `global_temperatures` schema:

1. Investigate the data in the `stg_temperatures_by_country` source for any data quality issues.
2. Clean up the "Country" column, removing leading/trailing spaces and converting the country names to the proper format using the `initcap` function.
3. Remove any occurrences of the Lenny face '( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)' from the AverageTemperature column.
4. Remove specified regex pattern `'[-#?()\\s]+'` within the REGEXP_REPLACE function. 
It will remove any occurrences of hyphens, pound signs, question marks, parentheses, or whitespace from the AVERAGE_TEMPERATURE column before aggregating the values.
5. Aggregate the temperature measurements per country on an annual basis using the AVG function to calculate the average temperature.
6. Select the following columns for the output table:
   - YEAR: Integer
   - COUNTRY: String
   - AVERAGETEMPERATURE: Float

Sample Output

| YEAR | AVERAGETEMPERATURE | COUNTRY   |
|------|-------------------|-----------|
| 1832 | 19.470083333      | Greenland |
| 1835 | 19.837833333      | Greenland |

:::note

In the SQL statement, the use of double quotes around the YEAR column name is necessary because it is a reserved keyword in Snowflake. 

``` select "YEAR" FROM TABLE ```
