We have discussed enought about data visualization, its importance, approaches and tools. Now let us look at one of the popular data visualization tool, Tableau.
Tableau is one of the top five widely used and a powerful data visualization tool that allows users to create interactive and shareable dashboards. Tableau has both enterprise commercial version and a individual non business free version.
It is widely used in business intelligence and analytics. Tableau is a powerful data visualization tool that allows users to create interactive and shareable dashboards provide the data is public.

Note: The primary reason why we choose Tableau for our learning is because of below reasons and it has no other special affiliations.
- For Microsoft Power BI, We need a Windows machine, which is not available for mac and installing windows inside mac had additional and cost overhead.
- For Qlik Sense, the trial version is limited to 30 days and the free version is not available for public use.


## Tableau Setup

The goal of this module is to learn the basics of Data Visualization alone, We will be getting to know the basic features of Tableau and how to use them to create simple visualizations. For in-depth learning of Tableau, we have lots of learning resources including Thoughtworks udemy's courses, So let keep in mind our goal is to learn the basics of Data Visualization for now.
