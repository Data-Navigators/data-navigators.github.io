# Tour Agenda

## 👩‍💻 Intro to Data Analyst
An introductory session focused on the role and responsibilities of a Data Analyst, including key skills, tools, and methodologies used in data analysis.

## 🔄 Data Processing
Learn about data cleaning and transformation techniques, including data wrangling, handling missing values, and data normalization.

## 📈 Data Visualization
Discover best practices in data visualization, including the use of visualization tools and libraries to effectively communicate data insights.

## 📊 Statistical Concepts and EDA
Explore fundamental statistical concepts essential for data analysis, such as descriptive statistics, probability distributions, hypothesis testing, and inferential statistics.

## 📊 Comparative Analysis
Comparative analysis in trend analysis helps you uncover key patterns by comparing data over time or across different categories. You'll learn how to identify trends, spot deviations, and provide insights to make data-driven decisions for business.

## 📊 Business Intelligence Tools
BI tools streamline data analysis by transforming complex datasets into interactive, visual reports, making insights more accessible and actionable for decision-makers.Explore BI tools like Power BI and Tableau, to apply your DA skills for quick delivery of data insights.

## 📊 Data Modeling
BI tools streamline data analysis by transforming complex datasets into interactive, visual reports, making insights more accessible and actionable for decision-makers. Knowledge of Data Modeling is essential to understand the data and to design data products in an enterprise.

## 📊 Data Science and Interpretability 
Where an Analyst might ask for very specific or aggregated data (many cases, not all), a ML Engineer will more than likely ask for a subset of data but "as raw as possible". What they mean by this is that they want non-aggregated data as close to the source as possible. 

There is an extent to which some standardisation and harmonisation is ok (but it is important to document the transformations that have taken place as to not obscure any significant patterns that would have appeared in ML work).

## 📊 Case Study
We have provided 2 different datasets with problems or business asks associated with them. Please pick one dataset and use learning from the training to answer the given problems with data.
